# Data Engineer Challenge
## Introduction
The following tasks are to test the basic skillset of a data engineer.
You arenâ€™t expected to spend more than 30-60 minutes on this task (we respect your time).
You are free to use the internet but must solve this task yourself.
During your interview you will be asked to present (in any way you like) your thought process on how you went about completing this task.

## How to Use
Create a repo in your GitHub account (do not fork via GitHub!).
Then clone the contents of this repo into it:
git clone https://github.com/Sampuddy/DataEngineer-Challenge-master.git

## Objectives
1. Create a query that calculates the average number of goals per game between 1900 and 2000.
2. Create a query that counts the number of shootouts wins by country and arrange in alphabetical order.
3. Create a reliable key that allows the joining together of goal scorers, results, and shootouts.
4. Create a query that identifies which teams have won a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw.
5. Create a query that identifies the top goal scorer by tournament, and what percentage that equates to for all goals scored in the tournament.
